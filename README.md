# My Django Project

This project is a REST API backend developed with Django, as part of an internship assignment.

## Project Overview

The backend is developed in Django with Python. This project focuses on providing a set of RESTful APIs for handling courses, students, and instructors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.2+
- PostgreSQL (or another database of choice)
- Docker (for containerization)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/django-project.git
    cd django-project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the database:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. Run the development server:

    ```bash
   .python manage.py runserver
    ```

6.Run

# Myvenv Project

This project is built using Django and Python, with a virtual environment named `myvenv`. The backend APIs are structured to provide efficient data handling and processing for the application. All dependencies are managed using a `.env` file to ensure easy setup. Docker is used for containerization to simplify deployment. The project can be run locally using `python manage.py runserver` after activating the virtual environment. This repository includes clear setup instructions, API endpoints, and guidelines for contributing.
